### Bug Fixes
- **ID Card Download Error:** Fixed an issue where the ID card download would fail with the error `Error: Attempting to parse an unsupported color function "oklch"`. This was resolved by upgrading the `html2canvas` package to `html2canvas-pro`, which provides enhanced support for modern CSS features.
